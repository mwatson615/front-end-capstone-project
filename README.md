Concept:
Superlative is intended to settle disputes over who or what is the greatest or worst at doing something. It draws on the concepts of Urban Dictionary and Guinness Book of World Records and relies on no factual information as facts cannot be disputed. This allows users to, for example, list themselves as the greatest guitarist, or their pets as the greatest dogs or cats. 

Requirements:
1. Must use Angular
2. CSS Framework not specified in requirements: Bootstrap used
3. Must be able to register and authenticate user
4. User must be able to Create, Read, Update, Delete information
5. Firebase used for REST functionality

Lessons Learned:
Planning time is inversely proportional to build time. Extra planning on the front-end helped this project flow smoothly.
Angular is very powerful and fairly simple to use for this purpose. 
filter: {$:searchModel} is a great shortcut for implementing a search all
Problems of asynchronicity and changing partials based on events are easily solved with promise manipulation
